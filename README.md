## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

**"The Learning Crisis Every Student and Teacher Faces"**

### For Students:
- **Syllabus Overwhelm**: Staring at a long PDF syllabus, not knowing where to start
- **Generic Learning**: One-size-fits-all study materials that don't adapt to individual learning styles
- **Test Anxiety**: No personalized practice tests to gauge actual understanding
- **Progress Blindness**: No clear insights into what's been mastered vs. what needs work
- **Time Wastage**: Hours spent creating study plans instead of actually studying

### For Teachers:
- **Manual Organization**: Time-consuming process of organizing syllabus content manually
- **Student Engagement**: Difficulty tracking individual student progress and performance
- **Content Distribution**: Challenges in efficiently sharing learning materials with students
- **Assessment Creation**: Creating personalized tests for different difficulty levels is tedious

**The Reality**: Traditional education tools are built for institutions, not individual learners. Both students and teachers need AI-powered tools to maximize learning potential and teaching efficiency.
