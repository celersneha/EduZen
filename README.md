## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

**"The Learning Crisis Every Student Faces"**

As students, we've all been there:
- **Syllabus Overwhelm**: Staring at a long PDF syllabus, not knowing where to start
- **Generic Learning**: One-size-fits-all study materials that don't adapt to YOUR learning style
- **Test Anxiety**: No personalized practice tests to gauge your actual understanding
- **Progress Blindness**: No clear insights into what you've mastered vs. what needs work
- **Time Wastage**: Hours spent creating study plans instead of actually studying

**The Reality**: Traditional education tools are built for institutions, not individual learners. Students need AI-powered personalization to maximize their learning potential.
